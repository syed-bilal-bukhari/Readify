# Stop Hunting for Highlights. Start Building Knowledge.

**Readify is a research tool designed to function as a "recall engine" that transforms scattered highlights into a structured, instantly retrievable knowledge base.**

When you’re juggling dozens of books, articles, and notes, the hardest part isn’t reading, it’s finding the one reference that moves your work forward. Readify ends the chaos of screenshots and messy citations by turning every highlight into a reliable, retrievable reference.

🛑 The Problem
Every serious researcher faces the same bottleneck: knowing more than you can reliably recall and retrieve.

- Messy references: Scattered notes, screenshots, and bookmarks never line up when deadlines hit.
- Relevance lost: You know you’ve seen a specific passage, but can’t find it in time to push your work forward.
- Momentum killers: Context switching, manual scanning, and re-reading sap hours and confidence.

⚡ The Solution
Readify makes your reading actionable. Highlight once, and you get:
- Hierarchical Order: Arrange references in an infinite-depth topic tree that mirrors how you think.
- Instant Navigation: Focus on easily recalling research with just a click.
- Connected Insight: See how ideas connect across authors, chapters, and volumes with meaningful designations.

🌟 Signature Features
- Hierarchical Topic Tree: Organize references the way experts think — from high-level fields down to granular subtopics.
- Instant Page Jump: One click opens the exact page inside the exact PDF, with the right highlight waiting for you.
- Fast Spotlight Search: Type a topic, see all connected references instantly.
- Cross-Book Linkage: Highlights can live under multiple topics and appear across unrelated branches.
- Local & Private: Everything runs on your machine; your PDFs stay yours.

📖 How It Works
Readify uses a simple workflow to convert reading into a living knowledge base:
1. Read: Open any PDF from your personal library.
2. Highlight: Draw a box around the passage that matters.
3. Classify: Add topics (one or many), tags, and reference details (book/volume/chapter/page).
4. Retrieve: Search by topic and open straight to the correct page and highlight — across your whole library.
Visualizing Your Research
The Topic Tree allows you to manage the full topic hierarchy. You can add, rename, or move nodes to explore the graph layout of your knowledge.

The Research Interface lets you pinpoint exact passages, such as specific diagrams or paragraphs, ensuring you have page-level proof for your arguments.
