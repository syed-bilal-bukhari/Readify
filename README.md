# Stop Hunting for Highlights. Start Building Knowledge.

**Readify is a research tool designed to function as a "recall engine" that transforms scattered highlights into a structured, instantly retrievable knowledge base.**

When you’re juggling dozens of books, articles, and notes, the hardest part isn’t reading, it’s finding the one reference that moves your work forward. Readify ends the chaos of screenshots and messy citations by turning every highlight into a reliable, retrievable reference.


🛑 The Problem
Every serious researcher faces the same bottleneck: knowing more than you can reliably recall and retrieve.

- Messy references: Scattered notes, screenshots, and bookmarks never line up when deadlines hit.
- Relevance lost: You know you’ve seen a specific passage, but can’t find it in time to push your work forward.
- Momentum killers: Context switching, manual scanning, and re-reading sap hours and confidence.

⚡ The Solution
Readify makes your reading actionable. Highlight once, and you get:
- Hierarchical Order: Arrange references in an infinite-depth topic tree that mirrors how you think.
- Instant Navigation: Focus on easily recalling research with just a click.
- Connected Insight: See how ideas connect across authors, chapters, and volumes with meaningful designations.
