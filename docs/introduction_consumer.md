# Readify — Built for Researchers

When you’re juggling dozens of books, articles, and notes, the hardest part isn’t reading — it’s finding the one reference that moves your work forward. Screenshots pile up. Bookmarks multiply. Citations get messy. And when it’s time to write, teach, or defend a point, you can’t put your finger on the exact passage you need.

We built Readify to end that chaos. It turns every highlight you make into a reliable, retrievable reference — organized, connected, and ready the moment you need it.

## The Problem We Solve

- Messy references: scattered notes, screenshots, and bookmarks that never line up when deadlines hit.
- Too much to handle: dozens of PDFs across volumes and chapters, each with relevant passages you can’t immediately surface.
- Relevance lost: you know you’ve seen it, but can’t find it in time to push your work forward.
- Momentum killers: context switching, manual scanning, and re-reading sap hours and confidence.

If this feels familiar, you’re not alone. Every serious researcher faces the same bottleneck: knowing more than you can reliably recall and retrieve.

## The Promise

Readify makes your reading actionable. Highlight once, and you get:

- Hierarchical order: arrange references in an infinite-depth topic tree that mirrors how you think.
- Fast search: locate the right reference instantly — across your highlights, not just one document.
- Exact navigation: jump directly to the exact page in the exact PDF, with the right highlight waiting for you.
- Structured context: attach book, volume, chapter, page, topic(s), tags, and a short description — so the reference is meaningful when you return.
- Cross-book insight: see how ideas connect across authors, chapters, and volumes, not just where they first appeared.

## Who It’s For

- Academics and students synthesizing complex sources across semesters and disciplines.
- Scholars in the humanities building arguments across multi-volume works.
- Legal and policy researchers tracking precedence and citations.
- Scientists and analysts who need rapid recall with provenance.
- Educators preparing lectures and course materials anchored in exact texts.

If your work depends on pinpointing the right passage fast, this is for you.

## How It Works (No Jargon)

- Read: open any PDF from your personal library.
- Highlight: draw a box around the passage that matters.
- Classify: add topics (one or many), tags, and reference details (book/volume/chapter/page).
- Retrieve: search by topic and open straight to the correct page and highlight — across your whole library.

Your reading becomes a living knowledge base you can trust.
