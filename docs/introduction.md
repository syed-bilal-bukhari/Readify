# 📘 Readify — Introduction & Overview

**Readify** is a local-first web application designed to help researchers, students, and academics read, highlight, organize, and retrieve information from large collections of PDF books with exceptional speed and structure.  
Instead of manually remembering where an important passage appeared inside a book, the system allows users to highlight text, classify it into topics, attach references (book, volume, chapter, page), and tag it for future retrieval. All highlights are stored in a structured database-like format, enabling fast search across **all PDFs**, not just the one currently open.

The core concept is simple:

> **Any passage you highlight becomes an instantly searchable knowledge node in your personal library.**

The application provides a clean, stable reading interface with a PDF viewer on the left and an intelligent search sidebar on the right. Users can search by **Topic** (organized in an infinite-depth tree structure) or by **Tags** (simple list-based search), and jump directly to the exact page and highlight inside any stored PDF. This eliminates the slow, manual process of scanning through books when writing papers, preparing lectures, or conducting deep academic research.

## 🎯 Goal & Purpose

The goal of Readify is to create a **personal research companion** that seamlessly connects:

- What you read
- What you highlight
- How those highlights relate to each other
- And how quickly you can retrieve them later

It is designed for individuals working with large academic resources—Islamic studies, humanities, legal texts, scientific PDFs, or any field where references span multiple books and topics.

The system aims to solve common problems such as:

- Losing track of where a reference was found
- Needing to search through dozens of PDFs manually
- Difficulty organizing complex academic topics
- Lack of fast cross-document search across personal libraries

By treating highlights as structured knowledge entries that can belong to multiple topics, the app provides a **personal, topic-driven knowledge graph** that grows as you read.

## 🚀 Core Use Cases

### 1. **Academic Reading & Highlighting**

- Open any PDF (book, paper, treatise).
- Highlight important passages.
- Assign structured metadata:
  - Topics (one or many nodes within the hierarchical tree; a single highlight can live under multiple, even unrelated, branches)
  - Book / Volume / Chapter / Page Number
  - Tags (keywords)

### 2. **Topic-Based Research**

- Search or browse your **Topic Tree**, which can have infinite subtopics.
- Visualize topics in a flow-style graph.
- Click any topic to view all connected references—including highlights that are shared across multiple topics.
- Instantly open the exact page and highlight in the related PDF.

### 3. **Tag-Based Retrieval**

- Search references globally across all PDFs by simple keywords.
- Tags act like flexible labels (e.g., _aqeedah_, _logic_, _politics_).
- Clicking a tagged reference opens the corresponding highlight immediately.

### 4. **Cross-Book Knowledge Mining**

- Find all references related to a concept—even if they appear in:
  - Different books
  - Different chapters
  - Different authors
- Build connections across your entire collection of PDFs.

### 5. **Local, Private Research Environment**

- Everything runs on **localhost**, with no external servers.
- All PDFs remain on your device.
- Designed to be lightweight, stable, and usable even offline.

## 🧩 Why This Matters

Readify creates a powerful workflow:

**Read → Highlight → Categorize → Search → Open → Cite**

No more scattered notes, screenshots, or bookmarks.  
No more wasted time looking for “that one paragraph on page 212”.

Instead, your reading becomes a growing, organized database of knowledge.
